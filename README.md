Welcome to the Rodney Amateur Radio Club - RARC
Whilst RARC meets in Wellsford, our members are spread across the Rodney and Kaipara districts - some even further afield such as the Far North and Australia.

RARC started life as the Wellsford Radio Club in the 1950's by its founders, Eycke Zimmerman ZL1AGQ and Alan Dale ZL1ABL, Alan is still a member and attends all our meetings! You can find out more about the [club's history here](./club_history.md).

We are very much focused on attracting new members to the club. You don't need to be a licenced operator, we welcome those interested in wanting to become amateur radio operators too. RARC's yearly membership subscription is very reasonably priced.

If you wish to enquire about joining RARC or just have an general enquiry then please contact one of us by email zl1rod.rarc@gmail.com.
